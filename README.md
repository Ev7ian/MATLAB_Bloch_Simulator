# MATLAB_Bloch_Simulator
MATLAB Bloch Simulator with GUI to visualize evolution of spin magnetization

Purpose: This project develops a MATLAB-based Bloch Simulator with an intuitive GUI to effectively demonstrate the dynamics of spin echo sequences in MRI. By leveraging the Bloch equations, the simulator provides detailed visualizations of magnetization vectors and pulse diagrams, enhancing the understanding of MRI physics. It aims to facilitate interactive exploration and hypothesis testing concerning the interactions between different tissue types and the spin echo sequence, thereby advancing educational and research applications in MRI technology.

Methods: The simulator was designed with MATLAB R2022a, using the embedded App Designer for GUI development. This approach ensured a systematic integration of key functionalities essential for simulating MRI sequences. Users interact with the simulator through input fields to specify core parameters essential to MRI simulations, such as T1 and T2 relaxation times, repetition time (TR), the number of isochromats (spins), and the quantity of RF pulses. This flexibility allows the simulation to mimic a wide range of MRI spin echo conditions. The visualization component of the simulator is particularly robust, featuring a 3D graphical representation of magnetization vectors. This visualization facilitates an intuitive understanding of the spatial and temporal evolution of magnetization. Additionally, a detailed plot dynamically displays the pulse sequence alongside the resulting transverse magnetization (Mxy), providing users with real-time feedback on the effects of their parameter choices. To tailor the simulation to specific experimental needs, dropdown menus enable selection and customization of RF pulses, including adjustments to their flip angles.
